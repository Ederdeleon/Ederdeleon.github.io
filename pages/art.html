    <h1>Lab Art - Brigham Young University-Idaho</h1>
    <img src="/images/artmockup.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Brigham Young University-Idaho has a lab on the library called the Mac Lab where I work as a graphic designer. In the Mac lab we help students with the Adobe programs like Illustrator and Photoshop, we do more things like 3D printing and other stuff, but in this post I will share one assignment I had for the lab. I got a message from the Mac Lab supervisor "Create a poster/artwork centered around a mundane object. We want you guys to have fun with it. Please be as experimental, silly, edgy, goofy as you would like, as long as it's still professional quality".
        The poster had to be 11x17,  the object they assigned me were glasses, and it had to be a typographic poster using the Mac Lab colors. 
        I will share some drafts I did and some of the feedback I got from my coworkers. </p>
        <h2>Mac Lab Colors </h2>

        <h2>Drafts </h2>
        <p>I had no idea what to create because it was supossed to be "art", at the same time I could only use the Mac Lab colors, use type as the main idea or element in the composition, and the object I am using in the poster are glasses, it was a challenging composition. 
            My first idea didn't look well....</p>
            <img src="/images/draft.png" alt="">
            <p>The message of this composition is that every person has a different perspective of everything in this life, every person sees things from a different perspective and it is not until we see clearly that we can comprehend why others act and think the way they do. This is saying life is beautiful in chinese but it's until you use your glasses that you can understand it whether you speak English or Chinese. 

                Feedback from Bailey Stafford (Graphic Designer)
                I like the visual effects that are happening here! I would try making a version where the background is our bluish teal just to see what that would look like. The all red is a little intense and I'm not sure if we want the lab art to look too aggressive. Those things being said; I also want to say that I think the glasses are imagery and right now they are the focus. I would probably try to use only type for your sketches and concepts. You can use something like a typogram or just cool type effects to communication something about vision (blur, scale, etc) You can extend glasses to vision, seeing, and anything that has to do with sight. I would come up with a strong concept like creative vision or seeing the future and make sketches of how you could experiment with type and typographic texture for this.</p>

            <p>I decided I wanted to create something different and I created this new concept where people measure their vison using typography, each font I used for each pair of glasses is different which means that every person sees diferently and they are unique, You can also see that each person has a different level of vision, some people see blurry and others see even more blurry. 

                Feedback from Loralee Price (Graphic Designer)
                I really like this! Eder is looks awesome!!! I think this is going to make an awesome poster. My one suggestion would be to possibly change the bright green lines to a different more on brand color because it stands out a lot against the other colors. Other than that I think it looks great, I love that you're showing multiple different fonts and it looks nice and clean. I can tell you put a lot of work into this project and it looks amazing!</p>
