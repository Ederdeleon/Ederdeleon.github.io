        <p class="first">Where it all began.....<br>
            I need to say that I was born from amazing parents in a loving house in Mexico State (not Mexico City), Mexico. <br>
            I had an incredibly fun childhood full of soccer games, family trips to the beach and great food!
        </p>
        <p class="second">
            I have played soccer competitively since I was 4 years old until today. Of course being a soccer player was the dream, <br>
            but it was never my goal. being pro was never my goal, I was just in love of soccer and that is why I am still playing it and will untill I am around 70. <br>

        <p class="third">
            I went to middle school in Ecatepec, Mexico State in a very dangerous area 30 minutes from my house in Tecamac. I Can only say that I had good grades <br>
            but I never really knew what I wanted to study, but I new that education would benefit me in the future. I would take a buss home adter school because <br>
            the gangs around my middle school were always cousing some problems. 
        </p>
        <p class="fourth">
            In high school I had great grades in calculus and chemistry, but I was the worst of my class in English, it was just not important to me back then. <br>
            Evryoe else seemed to know way more than me that I did't even try at all. I need to admit that the most fun part of high school were sports; I became the <br>
            captain in the soccer and volleyball team, I was also part of the folkloric ballet.  My school was small, I had to be the volleyball coach for men and women <br>
             for a couple month because the school did not have one.

        <p class="fiveth">
            Right after graduating from high school (Benemerito de las Americas) when I was 18 yeasr old, OI went to live in Cusco Peru, because of a religion mission for <br>
            two years. Yes, I was a missionary in the mountains, in small towns, rural areas, and in the amazon jungle. Those two years were amazing and I learned a lot <br>
            I fall in love with Peru and its people, food, culture and more. I also had to study every day, one of those studies where English, and I started to learn English because <br>
            of my mission in Peru.
        </p>
        <p class="sixth">
            After my mission I went back to Mexico and I wanted to keep practicing the english I learned in Peru so I started styding Business Management online in Brigham Young University Idaho. <br>
            After visiting Peru 2 years after with my family, I decided to apply on campus and went to BYU_I in person, where I changed my major to Web Design and Development because of some <br>
            programming classes that I liked and I have never coded before that so I wanted to create things and I wanted to learn to code too. So here I am, i have been living in Idaho for the last two <br>
            years in the cold Rexburg. While studying in BYU-I I started working as a Graphic Designer in the Mac Lab in the Library where I would have design projects and 3D printing files to work on. <br>
            I also had the oportunity to have an internship in Rising Up together where I redesigned the whole Wepsite, ther color scheme, and develop their Website using the Design I created for them.
